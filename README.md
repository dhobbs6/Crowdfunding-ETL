# Crowdfunding-ETL

## **Overview of the Project**


-This project consisted of using Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks to extract and transform and load data (ETL). Key concepts in the ETL process included cleaning data, data engineering, data modeling, etc. Then, with the knowledge of Python, Pandas, and data cleaning strategies, we transformed the data via formatting, splitting, converting data types, and restructuring to create a DataFrame that was loaded into a postgreSQL database as a CSV file. Lastly, Structured Query Language (SQL) was utilized to analyze and manipulate data.
